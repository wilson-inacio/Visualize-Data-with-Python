# Visualize Data with Python
"Visualize Data with Python" codecademy Portfolio Project
#### About: 
In this project I'll be creating a portfolio project that uses visualizations to communicate insights about a dataset.

#### Project Objectives:
- Create a project for a data science portfolio
- Use Pandas to clean and prepare data for exploration and analysis
- Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that answer data questions
- Report key findings

#### Dataset:
For my project, I decided to go with a dataset that correlates gaming habits with mental wellbeing.
**Data name:** Gaming Habits and Psychological Well-being: An international dataset about the Anxiety, Life Satisfaction and Social Phobia of over 13000 gamers
**Webpage:** [Study Page](https://osf.io/vnbxk/)

#### About the Dataset:
Constituted of 13464 users (12699 male, 713 female, 52 other) between 18 and 63 years. Participants resided in 109 different countries with most of the participants coming from the USA (4569), Germany (1413), the UK (1032) and Canada (994).

##### Background
- Age and Gender
- Country of origin
- Country of residence
- Employment status
- Highest Degree earned

##### Gaming habits
- Main game played (+ ranking, if applicable)
- Hours played per week
- Platform
- Motivation (fun, improvement, competition,...)
- Sociality (singleplayer, multiplayer, etc...)
  
##### Validated Scales
- Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN)
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7)
- Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL)
- Single Item Narcissism Scale (SINS)

#### Glossary:
Some key terms about the data:
- **SPIN Score:** Social Phobia Inventory, a 17-item self-rating scale used to measure the severity of social anxiety symptoms over the past week
- **GAD Score:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, a brief, seven-question self-report questionnaire used to screen for and assess the severity of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- **SWL Score:** SWL (Satisfaction with Life) score is the total score from the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), a 5-item questionnaire measuring global quality of life
- **SINS Score:** Single-Item Narcissism Scale (SINS), a research tool asking "To what extent do you agree with this statement: 'I am a narcissist'?"
